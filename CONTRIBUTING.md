# Contributing to `The Gita Initiative`

We would like to thank you for your interest in `The Gita Initiative` and are grateful that you have decided to make a contribution. We are very excited to work with you.

We invite you to join our team! Everyone is welcome to contribute code via pull requests, to file issues on GitHub, to help people asking for help, to help triage, reproduce, or fix bugs that people have filed, to add to our documentation, or to help out in any other way.

We grant commit access to people who have gained our trust and demonstrated a commitment to Bhagavad Gita.

We communicate primarily over [Github](https://github.com/gita/BhagavadGita/) and on [chat channels](https://join.slack.com/t/thegitainitiative/shared_invite/enQtODc2MzAzNzI5MTIyLTZkMGNlNjM2YWQxMTAzZGEwNjMwMzMyMmMzZmU5ZmUzMjllNWVlODU1MzUwMDgxZTIyOGE5ODM5YzgwZTU4ODI).

The goal of this document is to provide a high-level overview of how you can get involved.

## Asking Questions

Have a question? Rather than opening an issue, please ask away on [our chat channels](https://join.slack.com/t/thegitainitiative/shared_invite/enQtODc2MzAzNzI5MTIyLTZkMGNlNjM2YWQxMTAzZGEwNjMwMzMyMmMzZmU5ZmUzMjllNWVlODU1MzUwMDgxZTIyOGE5ODM5YzgwZTU4ODI).

The active community will be eager to assist you.

## Providing Feedback

Your comments and feedback are welcome, and the development team is available via a handful of different channels.

See the [Feedback Channels](https://github.com/gita/BhagavadGita/wiki/Feedback-Channels) wiki page for details on how to share your thoughts.

## Reporting Issues

Have you identified a reproducible problem in any of the apps? Have a feature request? We want to hear about it! Here's how you can make reporting your issue as effective as possible.

### Identify Where to Report

The Gita Initiative is distributed across multiple repositories. Try to file the issue against the correct repository. Check the list of [Related Projects](https://github.com/gita/BhagavadGita/wiki/Related-Projects) if you aren't sure which repo is correct.

### Look For an Existing Issue

Before you create a new issue, please do a search in [open issues](https://github.com/gita/BhagavadGita/issues) to see if the issue or feature request has already been filed.

Be sure to scan through the [most popular](https://github.com/gita/BhagavadGita/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Afeature-request+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc) feature requests.

If you find your issue already exists, make relevant comments and add your [reaction](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments). Use a reaction in place of a "+1" comment:

* üëç - upvote
* üëé - downvote

If you cannot find an existing issue that describes your bug or feature, create a new issue using the guidelines below.

### Writing Good Bug Reports and Feature Requests

File a single issue per problem and feature request. Do not enumerate multiple bugs or feature requests in the same issue.

Do not add your issue as a comment to an existing issue unless it's for the identical input. Many issues look similar, but have different causes.

The more information you can provide, the more likely someone will be successful at reproducing the issue and finding a fix.

### Final Checklist

Please remember to do the following:

* [ ] Search the issue repository to ensure your report is a new issue

* [ ] Simplify your code around the issue to better isolate the problem

Don't feel bad if the developers can't reproduce the issue right away. They will simply ask for more information!
